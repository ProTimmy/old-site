# Welcome to my personal site!

Think of this page as a Resume+! Here I can be a bit more creative with how I show off the stuff that's on my resume plus I can show you all of the stuff that didn't make the final cut (there's only so much stuff you can cram into one sheet of paper).

This website has been designed from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (jQuery). I've also based the theme on Google's Material Design theme - but I'm not a UI designer, so don't judge too hard!

## TODO:
 - Create initial landing page
 - Implement mateial theme
 - Design javascript aspect of the site
 - Make it mobile from the very beginning
