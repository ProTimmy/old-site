        <p>&emsp; Once upon a time, in a land far away, someone told me that I was half decent at writing. I took this to mean I was the best writer ever, and around the time I was 14 I decided I wanted to be a writer. While this dream did eventually fall through, my love for writing and telling stories did not go away.</p>
        <p>&emsp; This blog exists as a way for me to vent about several topics. Some may be related to Computer Science, what I'm currently working on, or something that might impress recruiters. Most will not, as I mostly write about whatever is in my mind at the moment. Most important of all, however, is that these pieces will all be my unedited opinions, as I want this blog to serve as a gateway into who I really am. I can't think of a better way for people to get to know me than this (aside from actually getting to know me in real life), so we'll give this a shot...</p>
